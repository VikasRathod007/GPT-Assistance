# GPT-Assistance Project

This project uses the GPT API through the Gradio Python library to create a simple assistance system. Follow these steps to get started:

1. Obtain your API key from [OpenAI's platform](https://platform.openai.com/).
2. Create a file named `.env` in the project directory and define your API key variable (e.g., 'key').
3. Install the `dotenv` library by running: `pip install python-dotenv`.
4. Install the `gradio` library by running: `pip install gradio`.
5. Run the project using `Main.py`.

Now, you're all set and ready to go!
